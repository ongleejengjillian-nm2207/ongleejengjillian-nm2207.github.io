      <!-- Section 1: 2 charts using Plotly and Chartjs-->
        <h2><center>How has Covid-19 affected tourism in Singapore?</center></h3><br>
        <!-- % change in International visitor arrivals from the top 15 markets (2021) [Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV -->
        <div id='myMap'></div>
        <center><p>As seen in the map above, Singapore saw a <b>significant</b> fall in international visitor arrivals in 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels. Many of these markets belong in Asia and Oceania. The most largest change in percentage was from Australia with a <b>99%</b> decrease in tourist arrivals. This is considerable change as around <b>1.14 million Australians</b> visited Singapore in 2019. With almost no tourists coming in from Australia, it is expected that Singapore's tourism will take a hit.</p></center>
        <center><p>To find out more, lets take a look at the line chart below!</p></center>
        <!-- tourism receipts in Singapore using a line chart-->
          <center><canvas id="section1-line-chart" width="700" height="450"></canvas></center>
          <center><p>This chart clearly shows the changes in the total Toursim receipts in Singapore. As we can there was a huge dip in tourism receipts from 2019 to 2021. Compared to the <b>whopping $26.94 billion</b> generated in 2018, <b>only $1.89 billion</b> was generated in 2019.</p></center> 
            <center><p>But hold up! That still seems quite a lot is it not? But no, Singapore's is <b>largely dependent on tourism as it accounts for roughly 5.1% of the Gross Domestic Product(GDP)!</b></p></center>
          

      
      <!-- Section 2: 1 bar chart-->
        <h2><center>Which industries were hit hard?</center></h3>
          <!-- bar chart comparing the revenue earned by the hotel industry pre and present pandemic -->
          <p><center>Now it is important to note that <b>many industries</b> were greatly affected as no one anticipated the long term severity of the pandemic.</center></p>
          <center><canvas id="section2-bar-chart" width="700" height="450"></canvas></center>
          <center><p>These 2 bar graphs represent the months September in the years 2019 and 2021. With such a <b>drastic drop of $300 million</b> from 2019 to 2021, it can be inferred that many individuals working in such related industries would have been laid off. Hence we can see that Covid-19 not only had an adverse impact on industries, but it also affected the lives of working individuals.</p></center>
          <!-- Section 3: pie chart -->
        <h2><center>Why should we care?</center></h3>
          <center><p>Why should we ordinary citizens care about such facts? Well it is impossible not to since Covid-19 has so deeply affected our daily lives and lifestyles. With a limitations placed on our social mobility, we too are unable to partake in touristy activities abroad.</p></center>
          <center><div id='myPie'></center></div><!-- Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV -->
          <center><p>This pie chart depict the frequency of visit for the year 2019. It is evident that many tourists frequent Singapore on a repeat basis, which implies that Singapore has given tourists a good impression, so much so that <b>51%</b> of said tourists have chosen to Singapore again!</p></center>
          <center><div id='myPie2'></center></div><!-- reasons for visit [Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV] -->
          <center><p>Furthermore this next pie chart gives us a breakdown on the main purposes of visit. A large majority of which either visited Sinagpore for Holiday or to visit their friends and family.</p></center>
          <center><p>Hence this bring us back to the main question: Why should we care? Well from the statistics alone we can infer that the majority of tourists that come to Singapore on a repeat basis are likely from our neighbouring country, Malaysia. Despite this close proximity, those with family in Malaysia and Singapore were separated from Covid-19 restrictions. Therefore looking beyond the economic impact the Covid-19 brought on tourism, Covid-19 had more importantly removed one's <b>freedom of mobility and the ability to connect with loved ones.</b></p></center>
